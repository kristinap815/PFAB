#! 
first = "Kristin"
last = "Powers"
age = 34

print first, last, age


operand1 = 95
operand2 = 64.5

print operand1 + operand2
print operand1 - operand2
print operand1 * operand2
print operand1 / operand2
print operand1 % operand2

# This solution is best because if one operand changes, then only one variable would need to be rewritten, versus the entire program.
